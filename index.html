    <p>
        This portfolio will be a culmination of my work throughout the semester. Each piece of work will showcase my creativity and technical ability in order to create visually engaging projects. With the use of HTML and CSS I aim to blend art and technology into structured code with aesthetic visuals which will be a representation of my growth in the digital media and web development field throughout through the semester.
